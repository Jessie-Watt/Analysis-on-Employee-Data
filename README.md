# TASK 1

#  **Introduction**

This is my first task on data analysis, using Excel Spreadsheet and its tools to development a table with 20 rows of data field information containing employees identification, their salary scale and their work positions. The 'Filter Tool' will be extensively applied to split fullnames, streamline employees salary scale above a certain range and also to determine the highest and lowest payed staff.

# **Activty**

1.	To create a table with 20 rows and 5 columns of Employee ID, Employee Fullname, Department, Salary and Job Type
2.	Show employees who are freelancers and highlight salary above $10,000
3.	Split employees' fullnames into first name and last name and highlight any duplicate found.
4.	Highlight employees whose names begin with the letter 'E' in yellow and highlight the highest salary with green background and the lowest salary with red background.

# **Skills Demonstrated**

1. Data Processing
2. Use of Filter Function
3. Use of Text-to-Column
4. Conditinal Formatting
Tool Used: Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet

# **Data Processing**
The attached screenshot (Raw Data Task 1) is my personnally constructed raw data of employees showing their different identity numbers, their Fullnames, Salary, and Job type.

To process this data I applied the Filter funtion on the salary column by left-clicking and selecting greater than 10,000, this revealed only employees with salaries above $10,000, thereafter I applied the same filter funtion to the 'Job Type' column selecting only freelancers. This automatically provided the dataset  for just freelancers who earned aboved $10,000 with their different identification numbers.

To carryout the third activity, I used the Text-to-Column function to split the fullnames of the employees, into firstnames and lastnames on separate columns. This was done by highlighting the Fullname column then I clicked on the 'text-to-column', selected 'delimeted' then 'space' and highlight the required columns for the new nams then click finish. This simply popped-up two new columns with their firstnames and lastnames as seen in 'worksheet 2' below. Thereafter I used the conditional formatting function to find duplicate names on the Firstname and LastName Column which was highlighted in red.

To determine the employee's with the highest and lowest salary, I highlighted the salary column then selected the conditional formatting function to determine the 'Top 1 Value' by highlighting the cell background and the value with dark green colour, also applied the 'Bottom 1 value' to the salary column by highlighting the cell background and the value with dark red colour. I also used the filter function to select and highlight employee names that begins with 'E' then I filled the background colour with yellow.

# **Conclusion**

This is my first data analysis task using data to tell a story and Github to discuss and document my data process, I am delighted to be on this learning path. 
Thank you Chinonso and Somadina.
